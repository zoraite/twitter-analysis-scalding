twitter-analysis-scalding
=========================

This project has some map-reduce Jobs to deal with tweets, specially a huge number of them.
It relies on Scalding framework for Scala language to execute the jobs on a hadoop environment.

- bin: executables to run the jobs
- src: source codes of the jobs

Since it runs on hadoop, the dataset must be added into hdfs.
